# SUMMARY
This is a project I did for my school, which are some simple school systems.
Part 1 is a registration system, which allows users to check the enrollment for each course.
Part 2 is a quizzing system, which allows users to get quiz information, check their quiz score and get score reports for class.
Part 3 is a communication platform, which allows users to create accounts and send messages through it.
